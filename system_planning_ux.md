## Question 3: Consider  your digital counting system and the different types of system installation presented in the textbook. Justify the choice of one installation system for your digital counter. 
I would use parrallel installation as for two reasons. Firstly, as our digital counter has to be run 24/7 for our clients, the continuation of the old programme in vital. This way, the clients can still use the counter while the new programme is being installed. Secondly, parralell installation has very little risk, making it safe.

## Question 4: What strategies could you use to provide user documentation for your digital counting system?
Since our product is an easy to use physical good, it would be most simple to provide a printed manual explaining the functions. Furthermore, our digital counter does not have many functions, therefore, a digital manual is useful. We could also provide a video manual as well. Other than that, we can have a list of frequentally asked questions just in case the buyers are not satisfied with our manual.

## Question 5: Think about ways to improve the usability, usefulness and desirability of your digital counter. Describe how your counter system addresses these three fundamental parts of the UX.
